# Dividends-Distribution-
This Smart contract allows an admin to make a distribution of dividends to the holders of their ERC20 tokens. 

Once the admin has deposited the benefits into the Smart contract, the Smart contract updates its information and calculates the current dividend per token. Dividends are not distributed automatically to token holders, so once the total dividend per token is known, then it is the holder who has to call a function in order to claim their dividends.

This smart contract can be designed for the case where the tokens represent shares of our company and we want to distribute the dividends among investors in a fast and transparent way using the blockchain.

The overall dividend process can be seen below:
